										<p><span class="questionwhite">Congratulations on receiving a number of mentions in the QOS! What advice would you pass on to those who want to achieve this level of recognition within their role?</span>
										My aim is to always to achieve the best outcome for the client in the quickest and most efficient way. However, I always consider all parties involved so that we can determine realistic timelines with the client. It’s always better to set a measured and achievable deadline rather than run the risk of over-promising and under-delivering. This requires having strong relationships with the different teams involved in each process.</p></div> 
<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-12"><p>
With every conversation I have, I always endeavour to go that extra mile in search of an answer. If I’m unable to resolve the query myself I always try to find someone better positioned to help.<br><br>

I also believe in becoming a ‘trusted advisor’ through acquiring in depth knowledge and actively networking with different people across the business. This builds trust and instils faith that you are able to correctly advise and support people. One of the ways I do this on a day to day basis is by keeping up to date with the latest enhancements and developments, so that my knowledge is always as strong as it can be.

			<p><span class="questionwhite">Last month saw our third ONE event, ‘Client’. If you were able to set the theme for the next event, what would you choose for it to focus on?</span> I would choose ‘Collaboration’ because, in order to be a stronger team, I feel we need to continue promoting it across Operations. It allows us to realise and fully support our vision by delivering to our clients as one team of people with a shared goal, rather than segmenting us into individual teams with separate achievements. This element of working is now a significant part of each person’s day, but there is always room for improvement.</p>
			<p><span class="questionwhite">What sort of challenges do you face on a daily basis as a reporting consultant? </span>
			Managing client expectations is definitely a challenge. Sometimes it can be difficult to commit to deadlines whilst accurately establishing timescales for the internal creation and development of the required materials. Having to do this, as well as manage other queries and projects across the business can be stressful from time to time. However, strong organisation skills and effective planning are key aspects when overcoming these obstacles.</p>

So far we have booked the venue and the band, so you could say that some of the most important things are done!
