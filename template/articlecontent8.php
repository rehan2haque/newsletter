<h3>The IT Transformation Process</h3>

<p>As part of the IT Transformation that WPP is undertaking across the group, our IT support has now been outsourced to IBM, who provide us with a 24/7 helpdesk accessible via the Service Now self-service portal <a href="https://coretech.service-now.com" target="_blank">https://coretech.service-now.com</a>, or by dialling 444444 from your extension. To ensure continued improvement and quality delivery of the IT service to KWP UK, an initiative taken by Jeremy in the restructuring of Operations - a new function was created within our IT under the Business Support department called the IT Liaison team. 
</p><br>
<p>
This team is comprised of Husam Aljabi, who has joined us in August 2015, and our own Randeep Mann who has supported the 2014 and recent 2015 IT Audits conducted by WPP. Husam (Sam) has joined us from International SOS, a global outsourced healthcare provider where he was based in Dubai. Traveling extensively in the MEA region, he was in charge of delivering IT services and projects, while looking after infrastructure and operations in that region. 
</p><br>
<p>
The IT Liaison team’s job is to manage the relationship with IBM’s various service delivery teams and ensure that the company is getting it’s a quality product in return for its investment and that all our users are happy with the level of service. They also act as our point of escalation in the event any request is “stuck” and needs to be nudged along.
</p><br>
<p>
The overall IT transformation journey will be a long one and we’re really only just beginning; we are bound to encounter a few teething issues along the way as IBM become better acquainted with our systems and we appreciate the knock on effects IT issues can have on our delivery schedules and so we would like to thank you all for the patience and understanding you have shown during this initial upheaval. The good news is that now that the transition has commenced, we can also expect to see some landmark developments coming through fairly soon and fairly frequently, which we will of course keep you updated with right here in the Operations Newsletter.
