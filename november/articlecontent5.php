		<h3>LEAN SNAPSHOT</h3>
		<p>

		<strong>What is Lean?</strong><br>

		Lean is a way of working that relentlessly seeks to create value for customers and eliminate any activities that do not. 

		It is a mind-set of rethinking everything we do and supporting each other to achieve this, enabling us to deliver outstanding service, long-term business success and motivated colleagues.
		
		<br><br>
		<strong>What does that mean for KWP?</strong><br>

		Lean fits perfectly with our identity and vision to Drive Client Growth. We will be actively identifying and understanding customer needs while ensuring that we utilise our resources in the most effective way to deliver value to our clients in order to drive their businessâ€™s forwards, and in turn ours.
